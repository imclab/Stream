# Stream is a tool for thinking.

Wikis are a great tool for brainstorming complex ideas, abstracting away the structure that can get in the way of new thoughts bubbling up. Unfortunately, they still require forethought and management of forward-links. A wide project can quickly require a lot of curating to maintain the connections between ideas.

Stream seeks to overcome this limitation by linking droplets together on-the-fly. By automagically merging new ideas into the existing flow, Stream lets its users spend more time creating and less time maintaining.

Stream was written in Ruby (1.9.3) using the [Shoes](http://shoesrb.org)(3.1) GUI toolkit.
